# Digit-Recognizer
Classification of handwritten digits, 10 classes (0–9). Given a dataset of labeled handwritten images, build a classifier that would assign correct labels to the new (not seen by the model) images.
We will solve a simple written digits recognition task (MNIST) and compare our results with others’. 
we can divide our labeled data into training and validation sets. We will let our model learn on the training set and validate its performance with the validation set.
Training 42K lable dataset images.
Testing 28k lable dataset images.
 we can build our Convolutional Neural Net model.
 Below CNN model gives about 0.995 accuracy and is a good starting point. Feel free to modify and improve it!
 Lets start training and monitor for 10 epochs
